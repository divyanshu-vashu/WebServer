CERN HTTPd (also known as the CERN web server) was one of the first web servers but is now obsolete. However, if you're working on an older system or a research project involving CERN HTTPd, you can follow these steps to set up a simple static HTML server.

### Steps to Set Up a Simple CERN HTTPd Server:

1. **Download CERN HTTPd**  
   Since CERN HTTPd is no longer maintained, you might need to find an archived version. If you have an old UNIX-based system, it may still be available in the package manager.

2. **Install and Configure CERN HTTPd**
   Extract and install it, then create a configuration file.

3. **Create a Sample Static HTML Page**
   Place an `index.html` file in the document root directory.

### Sample Configuration and HTML Setup:

#### 1. **Create the HTML File**
Create a directory for your web content (e.g., `/var/www/html/`).

```sh
mkdir -p /var/www/html
```

Create an `index.html` file inside `/var/www/html/`:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Welcome to CERN HTTPd</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello, this is a static HTML page served by CERN HTTPd!</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

#### 2. **Create the CERN HTTPd Configuration File**
Typically, the CERN HTTPd config file is named `httpd.conf` and is placed in `/etc/httpd.conf` or `/usr/local/etc/httpd.conf`.

Example configuration:

```ini
ServerRoot /var/www
DocumentRoot /var/www/html
Port 8080
User nobody
Group nobody
```

#### 3. **Start the CERN HTTPd Server**
Run the server using the following command:

```sh
httpd -r /usr/local/etc/httpd.conf
```

Now, you should be able to access the server in your browser at:

```
http://localhost:8080
```

### Alternative: Using Python's Simple HTTP Server
If you can't use CERN HTTPd but still need a simple static file server, you can use Python:

```sh
cd /var/www/html
python3 -m http.server 8080
```
